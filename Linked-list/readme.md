# Linked-List
* A linked list is a data structure that consists of a sequence of nodes. Each node contains data and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence. The first node in the sequence is called the head, and the last node is called the tail.
* Linked lists are a versatile data structure that can be used for a variety of applications. They are often used for storing lists of data, such as a grocery list or a list of tasks to be completed. They can also be used for implementing queues and stacks, which are data structures that are used to store data in a first-in, first-out (FIFO) or last-in, first-out (LIFO) order.
* Linked lists are a dynamic data structure, which means that they can grow and shrink as needed. This makes them a good choice for applications where the size of the data is not known in advance.
### Advantages of linked lists:
* They are dynamic, which means that they can grow and shrink as needed.
* They are easy to insert and delete elements from.
* They are not as memory-intensive as other data structures, such as arrays.
### Disadvantages of linked lists:
* They can be slower than other data structures, such as arrays, for accessing elements by index.
* They can be more difficult to manage than other data structures, such as arrays.
